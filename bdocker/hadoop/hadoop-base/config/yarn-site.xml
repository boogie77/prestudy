Configurations for ResourceManager and NodeManager:
    yarn.acl.enable				true / false	Enable ACLs? Defaults to false.
    yarn.admin.acl				Admin ACL		ACL to set admins on the cluster. ACLs are of for comma-separated-usersspacecomma-separated-groups. Defaults to special value of * which means anyone. Special value of just space means no one has access.
    yarn.log-aggregation-enable	false			Configuration to enable or disable log aggregation

Configurations for NodeManager:
    yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory-mb:		Resource i.e. available physical memory, in MB, for given NodeManager						Defines total available resources on the NodeManager to be made available to running containers
    yarn.nodemanager.vmem-pmem-ratio:    		Maximum ratio by which virtual memory usage of tasks may exceed physical memory	The virtual memory usage of each task may exceed its physical memory limit by this ratio. 	The total amount of virtual memory used by tasks on the NodeManager may exceed its physical memory usage by this ratio.
    yarn.nodemanager.local-dirs:        		Comma-separated list of paths on the local filesystem where intermediate data is written.	Multiple paths help spread disk i/o.
    yarn.nodemanager.log-dirs:          		Comma-separated list of paths on the local filesystem where logs are written.				Multiple paths help spread disk i/o.
    yarn.nodemanager.log.retain-seconds:		10800				Default time (in seconds) to retain log files on the NodeManager Only applicable if log-aggregation is disabled.
    yarn.nodemanager.remote-app-log-dir:		/logs				HDFS directory where the application logs are moved on application completion. Need to set appropriate permissions. Only applicable if log-aggregation is enabled.
    yarn.nodemanager.remote-app-log-dir-suffix:	logs				Suffix appended to the remote log dir. Logs will be aggregated to ${yarn.nodemanager.remote-app-log-dir}/${user}/${thisParam} Only applicable if log-aggregation is enabled.
    yarn.nodemanager.aux-services:				mapreduce_shuffle	Shuffle service that needs to be set for Map Reduce applications.

Configurations for ResourceManager:
    yarn.resourcemanager.address					ResourceManager host:port for clients to submit jobs.										host:port If set, overrides the hostname set in yarn.resourcemanager.hostname.
    yarn.resourcemanager.scheduler.address			ResourceManager host:port for ApplicationMasters to talk to Scheduler to obtain resources.	host:port If set, overrides the hostname set in yarn.resourcemanager.hostname.
    yarn.resourcemanager.resource-tracker.address	ResourceManager host:port for NodeManagers.													host:port If set, overrides the hostname set in yarn.resourcemanager.hostname.
    yarn.resourcemanager.admin.address				ResourceManager host:port for administrative commands.										host:port If set, overrides the hostname set in yarn.resourcemanager.hostname.

Configurations for History Server (Needs to be moved elsewhere):
    yarn.log-aggregation.retain-seconds:            	-1	How long to keep aggregation logs before deleting them. -1 disables. Be careful, set this too small and you will spam the name node.
    yarn.log-aggregation.retain-check-interval-seconds:	-1	Time between checks for aggregated log retention. If set to 0 or a negative value then the value is computed as one-tenth of the aggregated log retention time. Be careful, set this too small and you will spam the name node.
